# dotnetcore-demo
This repository will be used to hold a sample dotnetcore razor page demo application (using dotnet core 2.2.) It is the sample app provided by Microsoft and has no external dependencies or database connections.

If you are the intended recipient of this repository, please build the code in this repository and deploy it to Azure. Your final solution should ultimately be automated, such that a code commit will initiate a new build and deployment. 

Good luck!
